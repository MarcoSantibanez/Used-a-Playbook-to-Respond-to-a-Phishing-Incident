# Used-a-Playbook-to-Respond-to-a-Phishing-Incident
My response to a phishing incident that involves a malicious file hash.
Tools used:   *SOC playbook*
              *Google Docs*
              

As level-one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. I received a phishing alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. After investigating the email attachment file's hash, the attachment had already been verified malicious. Now that I had this information, I had to follow my organization's process to complete my investigation and resolve the alert.
